        <h1>Web Components: Lesson n: Creating Web Components For Use in Your Projects</h1>
        <h2>(about 20 minutes)</h2>
        <p>This will be the most complex lesson involving creating a custom Web Component and using it in a web application. For the web developers at my work this will mean using this lesson as a reference and doing the work in a project file repository.</p>
        <p>This also needs to include details such as the ideas of AngularJS integration and global and specific services that communicate with each other. Be sure to update project documents with this information.</p>
