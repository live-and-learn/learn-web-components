# learn-web-components

Welcome to the Web Components course.

This course is designed to quickly introduce you to Web Components, get you started using them in general, and then using them specifically in your own projects.

The course starts with a lesson that is very basic, but teaches a complete Web Components concept. Each lesson introduces more complexity with a complete lesson and exercise. Feel free to skip any sections you don't think you'll need. The course instruction should take about *hh* to complete. Feel free to take more time to practice if you would like.

You will be using the instruction from and completing tasks in the files in this repository.

Now would be a good time to clone a fork of this repository so that you can load the files into your code editor and experiment with making changes to the Web Components in the lessons.

Once you have cloned a fork of this repository to your computer, open this file in your Chrome browser: /learn-web-components/lesson-1/readme.html
