# learn-web-components

Welcome to learning Web Components.

This course is designed to quickly introduce you to Web Components and get you started using them.

The course is very basic to start with and is organized in small sections. Feel free to skip any sections you don't think you'll need. The course instruction should take about <time_to_complete>. Feel free to take more time to practice if you would like.

The lessons in this course are actually in this Git repository (a place where code lives). You will be reading and watching the instruction from that repository and completing tasks using it. Don't worry about breaking it for others. You don't have access to the Git repository that would allow this.

With that, let's get started learning about Web Components. There are several technologies for creating components on a web page to provide specific functionality. Some of these technologies include jQuery, AngularJS, and React. A drawback to these technologies is that they are not native to web browsers. They require special code for them to run.

The idea of Web Components is to have a way to build web page components that use native functionality of web browsers. Usually, standards are created to guide the implementation of technologies on the Internet (for example, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and there is an effort to standardize the implementation of Web Components. This effort started a few years ago and is still going on.

That's right. The standard for Web Components is not finished. However, there is enough done that we can take advantage of this technology now. Some groups have built helpers known as shims to allow Web Components to be made and used in many of the more popular web browsers.

Ok. That should be enough to get started so, [click here to start the first lesson](https://github.com/live-and-learn/learn-web-components/tree/master/lesson-1 "Lesson 1 about Web Components and an introduction to native Web Components.").
