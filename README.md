Welcome to the Web Components course.

This course is designed to quickly introduce you to Web Components and get you started using them.

The course is very basic to start with and is organized in small sections. Feel free to skip any sections you don't think you'll need. The course instruction should take about 1 hour to complete. Feel free to take more time to practice if you would like.

You will be using the instruction from and completing tasks in the files in this repository.

Now would be a good time to clone a fork of this repository so that you can load the files into your code editor and experiment with making changes to the Web Components in the lessons.
