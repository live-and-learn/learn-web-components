# learn-web-components

Welcome to the Web Components course.

Yes, Web Components is yet another new technology for us to convert to. However, the idea of Web Components is that this technology is closer to existing native code that we have used in web browsers for years. The JavaScript that we will write for Web Components will be basically plain old JavaScript.

Do we guarantee that this will be the last conversion to a new technology? Of course not. This is the Internet after all and this is programming.

Web Components technology is exciting and has some pretty cool features. Also, they are pretty easy to figure out and we have tools baked into our web stack to help out. Anyway, we are sure that you can figure them out and we will do all we can to reduce the pain.

It will be work to convert our existing components, but we believe that it will be worth it when we have all of our code using the same technology and we enjoy some cutting edge ideas.
