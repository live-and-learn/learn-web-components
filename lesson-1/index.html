    <h2>What Are Web Components?</h2>
    <p>There are several technologies for creating components on a web page to provide specific functionality. Some of these technologies include jQuery, AngularJS, and React. A drawback to these technologies is that they are not native to web browsers. They require special code for them to run.</p>
    <p>The idea of Web Components is to have a way to build web page components that use native functionality of web browsers.
    <p>Usually, standards are created to guide the implementation of technologies on the Internet (for example, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and there is an effort to standardize the implementation of Web Components. This effort started a few years ago and is still going on.</p>
    <h2>Can I Use Them Now?</h2>
    <p>The standard for Web Components is not finished. However, there is enough done that we can take advantage of this technology now. Some groups have created shims to allow Web Components to be made and used in many of the more popular web browsers.</p>
